# skl
skeleton python web without formal MVC framwork\
## Why?
I made my hand dirty with django, flask and bottle\
Everyone is using it and it is reputed\
However, I come from barebone PHP, and, these framework felt itimidating\
Sometimes, my needs were simple. and creating django project was overkill\
I don't hop databases everyday. Why do I need M of MVC?\
I feel comfortable with HTML. Why do I need to learn template syntax all over again?\
Why trying to understand its internals of framework I came across mod_wsgi for apache2\
And skl (skeleton) is result of it.
